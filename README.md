# P5_ML5
This project was created in order to get experience creating javascript projects utilizing other libraries.
The libraries utilized are P5.js & ML5.js 
P5.js - p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else!

ML5.js - ml5.js is machine learning for the web in your web browser. Through some clever and exciting advancements, the folks building TensorFlow.js figured out that it is possible to use the web browser's built in graphics processing unit (GPU) to do calculations that would otherwise run very slowly using central processing unit (CPU).
          A really nice explanation of what is happening with GPUs can be found here - Why are shaders fast?. ml5 strives to make all these new developments in machine learning on the web more approachable for everyone.
